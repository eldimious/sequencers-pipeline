# Description

## Part 1

Generators and Iterators are new ES6 features that will allow things like this:

```js
function* fibonacci() {
 let [prev, curr] = [0, 1];
    for (;;)  {
      [prev, curr] = [curr, prev  + curr];
        yield curr;
    }
}
```

Using them in this way, we can do amazing things:

```js
let seq = fibonacci();
print(seq.next());  //  
print(seq.next());  //  
print(seq.next());  //  
print(seq.next());  //  
print(seq.next());  //  
```

The goal is to **implement pseudo-generators without the use of generators**.

The first thing to do is to implement the generator function:

```js
function  generator(sequencer)  {
  ...
}
```

`generator(sequencer[,  arg1, arg2, ...]) receives  a sequencer` function to generate the sequence and returns an object with a next()
method. When the next() method is invoked, the next value is generated. The method could receive as well optional arguments to be passed to the sequencer function. </br>

This is an example of a dummy sequencer:


```js
function dummySeq() {
  return function() {
    return  "dummy";
  };
}
```

To test generator(), you could use dummySeq() in this  way:

```js
var seq = generator(dummySeq);
seq.next(); //  'dummy'
seq.next(); //  'dummy'
seq.next(); //  'dummy'
....
```

When youâ€™re done, you should implement the following generators:

```js
function  factorialSeq()  {...} //  1,  1,  2,  6,  24, ...
function  fibonacciSeq()  {...} //  1,  1,  2,  3,  5,  8,  13, ...
function  rangeSeq(start, step) {...} //  rangeSeq(1, 2)    ->  1, 3,  5,  7,  ...
function  primeSeq()  {...} //  2,  3,  5,  7,  11, 13, ...
partialSumSeq(1,  3,  7,  2,  0)  {...} //  1,  4,  11, 13, 13, end
```

You can use any of  them  in  the same  way:


```js
var seq = generator(factorialSeq);
seq.next(); //  !0  = 
seq.next(); //  !1  = 
seq.next(); //  !2  = 
seq.next(); //  !3  = 
seq.next(); //  !4  = 
...
```

There are some sequences which are infinite and others are not. For example:

`primeSeq`: Is infinite
`partialSumSeq`:  Is limited to the passed values. </br>
When the sequence is done (in finite sequences), if you call seq.next() again, it should produce an error.

## Part 2

You have to implement the `pipeSeq() function`. This function allows you to pipe generator to some functions. Thus the generated sequence is streamed to a function.

`pipeSeq()` receives the sequencer function and optionally some parameters passed to the sequencer and returns and object with two methods:

1. `pipeline(pipe)`: receives the pipe function and optionally some parameters passed to the pipe function. It returns itself.

2. `invoke()`: return the piped sequencer object.


This  is  and example to  understand  this: </br>

Given this  pipeline  function:

``` js
function  accumulator() {
    var sum = 0;
    return  function(value) {
        sum +=  value;
        return  sum;
    };
}
```
``` js
//Example
var ac  = accumulator();  //  ac(1) ->  1,  ac(4) ->  5,  ac(2) ->  
```

We  could create  the piped sequencer like  this:

```js
var pipedSeq  = pipeSeq(rangeSeq, 2,  3)  //  2,  5,  8,  
            .pipeline(accumulator)  //  2,  7 (5+2),  15(7+8),  26(15+
)
            .invoke();
```


`pipedSeq` is a range sequencer whose values are streamed to the </br>
`accumulator()` function. This function sum the values of the sequence.


These are the expected  results:

```js
var seq = generator(pipedSeq);
seq.next(); //  
seq.next(); //  
seq.next(); //  
seq.next(); //  
...
```
The same pipedSeq object can have more than one pipe.

You should  implement too the isEven pipe function:

```
function  isEven(){...}
```
```
var ie  = isEven(); //  ie(1) ->  {status:  false,  number:1},  ie(
4)  ->  {status:  true, number:4}


# Requirements

- Need to run `npm install` to install all required packages

# Running tests

- To run the tests you have to run `npm run tests`
